# 100% Save files
This repo is just a place where I host my 100% BOTW save file. It's available in both Wii U and Switch formats. Make
sure to download the correct one for your console/emulator, because the save files aren't cross-compatible.

**How to Use**

Wii U/Cemu: Unzip files to `cemu_1.23.1\mlc01\usr\save\00050000\101c9400\user\80000001`, so that option.sav is at 
`cemu_1.23.1\mlc01\usr\save\00050000\101c9400\user\80000001\option.sav`. For Wii U console, do the same in FTPiiU, except
starting from the mlc folder instead of the Cemu folder.

Switch Console: Use Checkpoint Save Manager to load the saves in, it should have a folder it pulls from on the microSD card.
(I haven't needed to load saves on Switch in a few months, so I don't remember the exact filepath)
